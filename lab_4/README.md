# Lab 4 - Start near real-time Anomaly Detection

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use the detector in OCI OpenSearch and in near real-time feed the detector new data. Similar to before, you will use the Compute instance (on which NGINX runs) to start a Python script. That Python script (part_2.py) will generate many records and feed your OCI OpenSearch detector with near real-time data. You will be able to review the anomaly detection scores in real-time. When there is an anomaly that hits the treshold defined in the detector, you will receive an e-mail notifying you of the anomaly.

*Estimated Time:* 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Start the real-time Anomaly Detection Detector
* Review automatic e-mail notification


## Task 1: Start the real-time Anomaly Detection Detector using Oracle Cloud Shell

1.	Frx


## Task 2: Review automatic e-mail notification




You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
