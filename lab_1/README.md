2. On the next page, click on **Create Topic**. Add a name to the **Name** box and click on **Create**.
3. Click on the newly created topic to open the topic. When the topic is not directly visible, refresh the page.
4. Click on **Create Subscription**. Use **E-mail** as protocol and add your work or personal e-mail to the **Email" box. Click on **Create**.
